# Mechanics
#### Remove
There are two modes removing fixed elements from the screen. Aggressive mode and Moderate one. Aggressive is plain and straight: loop (in future traverse) through all the elements on the page, find naughty ones (position: fixed/sticky), make some additional checks, remove it.

Moderate on the other hand was super hard to develop (it still is), because I want it to be default mode, that won't block anything but "bad" popups. There are, of course, "good" ones. Send a tweet? Login to a website? Display some important info? Yeah these are popups as well. I developed a very smart algorithm to detect badness of the given popup, but there is still room for growth. So if you find a website where PopUpOFF blocks something important or doesn't block something you expect it to block - please, let me know. RomanistHere@gmail.com or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RomanistHere). It matters!</br></br>
#### Prevent
There is also [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) that allows PopUpOFF to check when some changes applied to the DOM. It re-checks added/changed elements with the algorithm to understand if it's a bad guy now. Made some interesting memoization with the WeakMap for Moderate mode.</br></br>
#### Tracking
Tracking is completely removed since 1.1.6</br></br>
#### Prevent paid content from hiding (Anti-paid) - since 1.1.6
Some newspapers are showing you an article you want to read and then remove half of it. Now it's in the past. There is an (experimental) option to prevent reduction of content after download. [More info here](https://romanisthere.github.io/posts/prev-cont-2/) </br></br>
